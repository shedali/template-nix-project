# CI Performance Optimizations Applied

## Changes Made

### ✅ Step 1: Better Nix Installer

- Replaced `cachix/install-nix-action` with `DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action`
- Added `DeterminateSystems/magic-nix-cache-action` for better caching
- **Expected improvement**: 30s faster Nix installation

### ✅ Step 3: Parallel Builds

- Combined all builds into one step running in parallel
- Uses bash `&` to run in background and `wait` to synchronize
- **Expected improvement**: 40-50% faster build phase

### ✅ Step 4: Cache Nix Store

- Added caching of `/nix` directory between runs
- Keyed on `flake.lock` for cache invalidation
- **Expected improvement**: Much faster subsequent runs

### ✅ Step 5: Remove Redundancy

- Removed Bun installation (Nix provides it)
- Removed duplicate React build (default = react)
- Simplified dev shell test
- **Expected improvement**: ~20s saved

## Performance Comparison

### Before Optimizations

- Nix installation: ~45s
- Sequential builds: ~60s
- No store caching: Full rebuilds
- **Total: ~2-3 minutes**

### After Optimizations

- Nix installation: ~15s (with cache)
- Parallel builds: ~30s
- Cached store: Incremental builds
- **Expected Total: ~45-60 seconds**

## How Parallel Builds Work

```bash
# All builds start simultaneously
nix flake check &         # Background job 1
nix build .#react -L &    # Background job 2
nix build .#server -L &   # Background job 3
nix build .#script -L &   # Background job 4

# Wait for each to complete
wait $PID1 $PID2 $PID3 $PID4
```

Instead of: Build1 → Build2 → Build3 → Build4 (sequential)
Now: Build1 + Build2 + Build3 + Build4 (parallel)

## Cache Strategy

1. **DeterminateSystems Magic Cache**: In-memory caching during the run
2. **GitHub Actions Cache**: `/nix` store persisted between runs
3. **Cachix**: Binary cache for pre-built packages

## Next Steps to Make It Even Faster

If you want to optimize further:

1. **Reduce Matrix** (not implemented):
   - Only test macOS on main branch
   - Would save 50% on PR builds

2. **Conditional Builds**:

   ```yaml
   - name: Build only if source changed
     if: contains(github.event.head_commit.modified, 'src/')
   ```

3. **Self-hosted Runners**:
   - Nix pre-installed
   - Warm caches
   - Could get builds down to 10-20s
