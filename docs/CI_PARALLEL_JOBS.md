# CI Parallel Jobs Implementation

## ✅ Successfully Switched to Parallel Jobs

### What Changed

**Before**: Single job with `wait` commands

```yaml
nix build .#react &
wait $PID
```

**After**: Separate parallel jobs

```yaml
jobs:
  build-react: # Runs independently
  build-server: # Runs in parallel
  build-script: # Runs in parallel
```

## Benefits You'll See

### 1. **Better GitHub UI**

Each job shows individually:

- ✅ build-react (ubuntu) - 45s
- ✅ build-react (macos) - 1m 2s
- ❌ build-server (ubuntu) - Failed [Retry]
- ✅ build-server (macos) - 50s

### 2. **Cleaner Logs**

- Each job has its own log stream
- No interleaved output
- Easier to debug failures

### 3. **Individual Retries**

- Can retry just the failed job
- Don't need to re-run everything

### 4. **Concurrency Control**

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

- New pushes cancel old runs
- Saves CI minutes

### 5. **Branch Protection Ready**

The `all-checks` job provides a single status for branch protection rules.

## Performance Impact

- **Total time**: Same or slightly better
- **Visibility**: Much better
- **Debugging**: Much easier
- **CI minutes**: More efficient (can cancel/retry individual jobs)
