# CI Conditional Logic Fix

## Problem

The `all-checks` job was requiring `docs-check` to pass, but `docs-check` only runs for docs-only changes. This caused source code changes to fail the final status check because:

- **Source changes**: `docs-check` gets skipped, `build-and-test` runs
- **Docs changes**: `docs-check` runs, `build-and-test` gets skipped
- **all-checks**: Required ALL jobs to complete, but some are always skipped

## Solution

Replaced the complex `re-actors/alls-green` logic with simple custom validation:

```yaml
all-checks:
  steps:
    - name: Check results
      run: |
        # For docs-only changes, docs-check should succeed and builds should be skipped
        # For source changes, build-and-test should succeed and docs-check should be skipped

        if [[ "${{ needs.docs-check.result }}" == "success" ]]; then
          echo "✅ Docs-only path completed successfully"
          exit 0
        elif [[ "${{ needs.build-and-test.result }}" == "success" ]]; then
          echo "✅ Build path completed successfully"  
          exit 0
        else
          echo "❌ No successful completion path found"
          exit 1
        fi
```

## Logic Flow

### Docs-Only Changes

```
changes: ✅ success
docs-check: ✅ success (runs)
build-and-test: ⏭️ skipped
macos-validation: ⏭️ skipped
all-checks: ✅ success (docs-check succeeded)
```

### Source Code Changes

```
changes: ✅ success
docs-check: ⏭️ skipped
build-and-test: ✅ success (runs)
macos-validation: ✅ success (runs on main) | ⏭️ skipped (on PR)
all-checks: ✅ success (build-and-test succeeded)
```

### Error Cases

```
changes: ✅ success
docs-check: ❌ failed | ⏭️ skipped
build-and-test: ❌ failed | ⏭️ skipped
macos-validation: ❌ failed | ⏭️ skipped
all-checks: ❌ failed (no successful path)
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear logic**: Either docs path OR build path must succeed
2. **No complex conditions**: Simple success/failure checking
3. **Debugging friendly**: Logs show exactly what ran and what was skipped
4. **Branch protection**: Single `all-checks` job for status requirements
5. **Flexible**: Works with any combination of skipped/successful jobs

This ensures CI always has a clear pass/fail status regardless of which conditional path is taken.
